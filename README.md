# HPX Custom port and basic serialization example

This repository demonstrates the creation of a custom HPX vcpkg port in a custom, 
local file system based registry and the use of basic HPX serialization.

It is just a learning and development example for some internal discussion and 
most likely of no use to anyone else.
